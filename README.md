## Abstract
*I want to show one possibility to proof the Collatz conjecture, also called
3n+1 conjecture, for any natural number N. For this, I limit my analysis on the
direct odd follower of every natural odd number and show the connections
between the already by one reached numbers and their followers, to find an
recurrence over all ranges [1,N_{i}], to proof the conjecture.*
